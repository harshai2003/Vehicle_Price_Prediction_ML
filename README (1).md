# 🚗 Vehicle Price Prediction using Machine Learning  

## 📌 Overview  
The **Vehicle Price Prediction System** is a machine learning-based project that predicts the price of a vehicle based on various factors such as brand, model, year, mileage, fuel type, transmission, and other specifications.  

The goal of this project is to assist buyers and sellers in determining a fair market price for used vehicles, helping them make informed decisions.
